    <header class="header">
        The header element represents introductory content for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning
        root element. A header typically contains a group of introductory or navigational aids. When the nearest
        ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element is the body element, then it applies to the whole page.
    </header>
    <nav class="nav">
        The nav element represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section
        with navigation links.
    </nav>
    <main class="main">
        The main element represents the main content of the body of a document or application. The main content area
        consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document or central
        functionality of an application.
        <section class="section">
            The section element represents a generic section of a document or application. A section, in this context,
            is a thematic grouping of content. Each section should be identified, typically by including a heading ( h1-
            h6 element) as a child of the section element.
        </section>
        <aside class="aside">
            The aside element represents a section of a page that consists of content that is tangentially related to
            the content around the aside element, and which could be considered separate from that content. Such
            sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography.
        </aside>
    </main>
    <footer class="footer">
        The footer element represents a footer for its nearest ancestor sectioning content or sectioning root element. A
        footer typically contains information about its section such as who wrote it, links to related documents,
        copyright data, and the like.
    </footer>
